											Cyberscape is my primary personal project, I've been working on it for some time now and hope to release it some time in the future.
								It is a Top-Down Action Roguelike, with a primary focus on the build and weapon diversity.

								..Of coure, Most Roguelike's say that. <br>
								In Cyberscape, All items are designed to be modular, whether it be the weapon or the items, they all work in tandem. <br>

								<br> There is no source code access due to this being a game I intend to release in the future, But if you have any questions I am happy to answer them!

										In terms of gameplay, an Item requires a sufficent amount of storage, in the case the player does not have the requirements, then it will be equipped as an inactive item.
										These items only provide a small stat boost. At the start of each floor and inside shops a player has the ability to change what items are active.

											Content creation for this project is all built around Blueprints. <br>

											This system is used for Items, Weapons and even A.I Characters making development of new content less time consuming.
											This also means that any designers that could be brought on would not need to go into the C++ to add content.

											The room builder is an incredibly useful tool that makes designing rooms a short process. <br>
											Utilising the various properties in the inspector you can define playspaces for the player and shape out rooms as required, as well as add item and enemy spawns.
											<br> Doors are also added this way and each room can have a custom door assigned to it if needed.
											<br> Changing the room's zone is also easy as it only requires a drop-down menu.
											<br> the biggest downside to the system is that it is a little bit tedious to use at times.
